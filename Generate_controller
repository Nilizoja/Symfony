CrÃ©ation d'un controller :

        C:\Users\prepavenir\PhpstormProjects\Formation_Git_2017_01\AddressBookSymfony>php bin\console generate:controller
        
        
          Welcome to the Symfony controller generator
        
        
        
        Every page, and even sections of a page, are rendered by a controller.
        This command helps you generate them easily.
        
        First, you need to give the controller name you want to generate.
        You must use the shortcut notation like AcmeBlogBundle:Post
        
        Controller name: AppBundle:Societe
        
        Determine the format to use for the routing.
        
        Routing format (php, xml, yml, annotation) [annotation]:
        
        Determine the format to use for templating.
        
        Template format (twig, php) [twig]:
        
        Instead of starting with a blank controller, you can add some actions now. An action
        is a PHP function or method that executes, for example, when a given route is matched.
        Actions should be suffixed by Action.
        
        
        New action name (press <return> to stop adding actions): listAction
        Action route [/list]:
        Template name (optional) [AppBundle:Societe:list.html.twig]:
        
        New action name (press <return> to stop adding actions): addAction
        Action route [/add]:
        Template name (optional) [AppBundle:Societe:add.html.twig]:
        
        New action name (press <return> to stop adding actions):
        
        
          Summary before generation
        
        
        You are going to generate a "AppBundle:Societe" controller
        using the "annotation" format for the routing and the "twig" format
        for templating
        Do you confirm generation [yes]?
        
        
          Controller generation
        
        
          created .\src\AppBundle/Resources/views/Societe/
          created .\src\AppBundle/Resources/views/Societe/list.html.twig
          created .\src\AppBundle/Resources/views/Societe/add.html.twig
          created .\src\AppBundle/Controller/SocieteController.php
          created .\src\AppBundle/Tests/Controller/
          created .\src\AppBundle/Tests/Controller/SocieteControllerTest.php
        Generating the bundle code: OK
        
        
          Everything is OK! Now get to work :).
